<b id="bh">The Harmandir Sahib</b>

</div></li>
<li id="b1"><img src="a1.jpg" style="width:100%; height:500px ;">

<p>
The Harmandir Sahib, also known as Darbar Sahib (Punjabi pronunciation: [dəɾbaːɾ saːh(ɪ)b]; "Abode of God", "Exalted Holy Court"), is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[2][3] It is the preeminent pilgrimage site of Sikhism.[2][4] It is usually called the Golden Temple in English, because it is plated with gold.

The Gurdwara sahib is built around a man-made pool (Sarovar) that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577.[5][6] Guru Arjan, the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mian Mir – a Muslim Pir of Lahore, to lay its foundation stone in 1589.[1] In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site Ath Sath Tirath (lit. "shrine of 68 pilgrimages").[2][7] The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Muslim armies from Afghanistan and the Mughal Empire.[4][8] The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it in 1757 and again in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage.[2] The construction work of the present day Harmandir Sahib took place in 1764 under the leadership of Sultan-e-Quam Sardar Jassa Singh 1718-1783 and other leading Sikh Misl Sardars and Jagirdars under Kaar Seva, large Sikh congregations assembled at Amritsar to help rebuild Darbar Sahib. Harmandir Sahib was finally completed in 1776.[9] Maharaja Ranjit Singh visited Darbar Sahib in 1802 after seizing Amritsar from Sardar Gurdit Singh Dhillon and his mother Mai Sukkha of Bhangi Sikh Misl. Maharaja laid it in marble and copper between 1820-1831, and overlaid the sanctum with gold foil by 1830. This has led to the name Golden Temple.[10][11][12] The architectural style of Golden Temple is influenced by Mughal architecture.

<b id="bh">The Taj Mahal</b>

</div></li>
<li id="b2"><img src="a2.jpg" style="width:100%; height:500px ;">
<p>
The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/;[4] Arabic: تاج محل‎, lit. 'Place or Position of the Crown', Hindi: ताज महल, lit. 'Crown of the Palaces' [taːdʒ ˈmɛːɦ(ə)l])[5] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan, the builder. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New7Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.

<p>
The India Gate (originally called the All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath, on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, India,[1] formerly called Kingsway.

India Gate is a memorial to 70,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died in the period 1914–21 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.The India Gate, even though a war memorial, evokes the architectural style of the triumphal arch like the Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens.

Qutub Minar was declared to be a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1993. It was built by Qutab-Ud-Din Aibak as a victory tower to commemorate the triumph of Mohd. Ghori over his arch rival Prithvi Raj Chauhan (A Rajput King) and its construction was completed by Qutub-Ud-Din Aibak’s successors hence. Being the tallest monument in Delhi and the second tallest minaret in India, it is a remnant of the grandeur of DelhiSultanate. What is noteworthy is that several parts of the Minar embrace Arabic and Persian inscriptions and Kufic calligraphy which tell the history of its construction and subsequent repair works.

<p>
FatehpurSikri was the erstwhile capital of Mughal dynasty before being abandoned by Akbar due to complete failure of water supply system. This was constructed as a well planned city by Akbar when he decided to shift his capital from Agra. It has been conferred the status of World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of the reason that it stands as one of the best examples of Mughal architectural finesse. A heritage tour to FatehpurSikri will let you explore some of its very impressive features like the Diwan-e-Aam, Diwan-e-Khas, Jama Masjid etc. BulandDarwaza (literal meaning: The great gate) stands out in the whole complex because of it being the largest gateway in the whole world.

<p>The Red Fort is a historic fort in the city of Delhi in India. Every year on the Independence day of India (15 August), the Prime Minister hoists the Indian "tricolour flag" at the main gate of the fort and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts.[1]

On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahore Gate. On each subsequent Independence Day, the prime minister has raised the flag and given a speech that is broadcast nationally.[2]

The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a Bahá'í House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986.[1] Notable for its flowerlike shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá'í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to form nine sides,[2] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34.27 metres[3] and a capacity of 2,500 people.[4] The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.[5] A 2001 CNN report referred to it as the most visited building in the world.[6]

<img src="a8.jpg" style="width:100%; height:500px ;">
<p>
Hawa Mahal (English translation: "The Palace of Winds" or "The Palace of Breeze") is a palace in Jaipur, India. Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur[1]. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its unique five floors exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of "purdah", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but in reality it is the back of that structure.[5]

The Charminar (lit. "four minarates"), constructed in 1591, is a monument and mosque located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The landmark has become known globally as a symbol of Hyderabad and is listed among the most recognized structures in India. The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 400 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for the popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid-ul-fitr.[3]

<img src="a10.jpg" style="width:100%; height:500px ;">
<p>
Elephanta Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.[1][2][3] They are located on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri (literally "the city of caves") in Mumbai Harbour, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) to the east of the city of Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra. The island, located offshore about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, consists of five Hindu caves and a few Buddhist stupa mounds that date back to the 2nd century BCE,[4][2][5] as well as a small group of two Buddhist caves with water tanks.[6][7]

The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures that show syncretism of Hindu and Buddhist ideas and iconography.[5][8][9] The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged.[10] The main temple's orientation as well as the relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern.[2] The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies, with the large monolithic 20 feet (6.1 m) Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.
